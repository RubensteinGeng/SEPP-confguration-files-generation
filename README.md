## **Overview of the 'files_generation.ipynb'**:
The files_generation.ipynb notebook is designed to generate the necessary configuration files for detection and measurement in SourceXtractor++ (SE++). Additionally, this notebook performs the following operations:

**Image Filtering**: Applies the specified filter to the image.\

**PSF Convolution**: Convolves the image with the specified Point Spread Function (PSF).\

**Noise Addition**: Adds noise to the image based on the noise level specified in the notebook.
All processed images and generated configuration files are saved to their corresponding file paths as defined in the notebook.

## **Parameters Adjustment**:
**Input Parameters**: Located below the function definitions in the notebook, these parameters are specifically tailored for our SKIRT simulations.\

**Configuration Parameters**: These parameters are used within the detection configuration files and are the primary settings you might need to adjust.\

**Noise Level (std)**: Defines the noise level, which is in the same units as the image itself. For JWST NIRCam detections, the noise is measured in MJy/sr.\

**Note**: The provided PSF, filter, and template files are configured for private use. Users can replace these with their own files as needed.

## **How to Use the Notebook**

**Running on a Cluster**:
Typically, you would run the files_generation.ipynb notebook directly on the cluster. Upon execution, the necessary files will be generated in the directory specified by their file names.

**Running as a Slurm Job**:\
If running the notebook directly is not feasible, you can convert the .ipynb file into a .py script. This script can then be submitted as a Slurm job on the cluster.

**Using SourceXtractor++**:\
With SourceXtractor++ installed, the SE++ can be executed directly using the configuration files generated by the notebook.

## **Example Workflow**
**Adjust Parameters**: Open the files_generation.ipynb notebook and modify the INPUT PARAMETERS and CONFIG PARAMETERS as needed.\
**Run the Notebook**: Execute the notebook on your cluster or convert it to a script and run it as a Slurm job.\
**Generate Files**: The necessary configuration and processed image files will be saved to the specified directories.\
**Execute SE++**: Run SourceXtractor++ with the generated configuration files.
